# ICI-FSL

\[[Project Page](https://yikai-wang.github.io/ici/)\]

This repository contains the code for the algorithm Instance Credibility Inference (ICI).

In V1, we implement an algorithm for measuring the credibility of pseudo-labeled instances for few-shot learning by a linear regression model with incidental parameters.

In V2, we extend our algorithm to a logistic regression model with incidental parameters.

Please read the corresponding readme under each folder for a detailed introduction.
