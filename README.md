This repository contains the code for the algorithm Instance Credibility Inference.

In the V1, we implement an algorithm for measuring the credibility of pseudo-labeled instances for few-shot learning by a linear regression model with incidental parameters.

In the V2, we extend our algorithm to a logistic regression model with incidental parameters.

Please read the corresponding readme under each folder for a detailed introduction.
